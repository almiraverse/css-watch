## **About The Project**

![Pink Watch CSS Art by Almira Mohammed Screen Shot](/images/css-watch-almira.png)

This project was my attempt at my second piece of CSS Art, a wristwatch made using HTML, CSS, and JS. This is a working watch in the sense that it can tell local time correctly.

It was certainly a challenging project to work on, but with some research and a lot of learning, it all came together in the end.


### Built With

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
